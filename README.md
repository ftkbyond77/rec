# Amazon Mouse Reviews Analysis Project

This README outlines a basic workflow for collecting, processing, and analyzing Amazon mouse reviews, with a focus on sentiment analysis and exploration, without including code.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher).
- You'll need a tool like Selenium for web scraping, along with a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
- Install necessary Python libraries: one for web scraping (Selenium), data handling (e.g., Pandas, NumPy), sentiment analysis (e.g., NLTK), and visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## 1. Collecting Data from Amazon
This step involves gathering mouse reviews from Amazon product pages using a web scraping tool.

### Process
- Set up a web scraping tool to control a browser automatically.
- Visit Amazon and search for "wireless mouse" or similar terms.
- Identify the review sections on product pages by inspecting the page structure.
- Extract key details: the review text, star ratings, and dates of the reviews.
- Save all collected data into a file, like a CSV, for later use.
- Be cautious: respect Amazon's terms of service and add delays to avoid overwhelming the site.

## 2. Processing Data
Prepare the collected data for analysis by cleaning and organizing it.

### Process
- Load the saved file into a data tool for manipulation.
- Remove any duplicate reviews or entries with missing information.
- Clean the review text by stripping out special characters and converting everything to lowercase for consistency.
- Standardize the ratings (e.g., convert "4.0 out of 5 stars" to just 4.0).
- Adjust the dates into a uniform format (e.g., "January 1, 2025" to "2025-01-01").
- Save the cleaned data into a new file for the next step.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis Modeling
Analyze the cleaned reviews to determine their sentiment—whether they’re positive, neutral, or negative.

### Process
- Use a sentiment analysis tool, such as a pre-built model from a library like NLTK, to evaluate the review text.
- Assign each review a sentiment score, then classify it: positive for favorable reviews, negative for critical ones, and neutral for those in between.
- Check the results by summarizing how many reviews fall into each sentiment category.
- Save the data with sentiment labels for exploration.

## 4. Exploring
Dive into the data to uncover trends and insights about the mouse reviews.

### Process
- Visualize the distribution of sentiments to see if most reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.
- Look at how average ratings change over time, grouping by months or years to spot trends.
- Examine common words: identify frequent terms in positive reviews (e.g., "great," "durable") versus negative ones (e.g., "broken," "cheap") to understand key themes.
- Save any charts or findings to review later.

## Usage
- Start by installing all required tools and libraries.
- Collect reviews from Amazon using the scraping process.
- Clean and organize the data as described.
- Run sentiment analysis to label the reviews.
- Explore the results with visualizations and word comparisons to gain insights.

## Notes
- Amazon’s page structure may change, so adjust your scraping approach as needed.
- Practice ethical scraping: avoid rapid requests and follow site rules.
- Your results, including data files and visualizations, will be stored in your project folder.
