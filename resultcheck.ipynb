      "Title: amazons's basics 3-button usb wired mouse, works good, looks good, reduces the emf\n",
      "Text: this amazon basics 3-button usb wired mouse is easy to review. it was delivered in a solid, well protected box. installing it was easy. it fit well, functions well, is responsive, and the design reminds me of when computer mouses were first introduced, so the familiarity is refreshing. it tracks well, without too fast or slow a speed and doesn't need batteries. i bought it because it is wired and helps reduce the emf around the computer from 20 mg with a wireless mouse to 0 mg for this one.\n",

      "Text: overview: the amazon basics responsive and precise 3-button wired usb computer mouse is a simple yet effective peripheral for everyday use. whether you're browsing, working, or gaming casually, this mouse delivers reliability and comfort without breaking the bank. it’s a no-frills, budget-friendly option for those who just need a solid, functional mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "build & design (4/5): the mouse has a minimalist design, featuring a matte black finish that’s smooth to the touch and resistant to fingerprints. it fits comfortably in most hands, though those with larger hands may find it a bit snug. the three main buttons (left, right, and scroll) are responsive and have a satisfying click, and the scroll wheel is accurate and not too stiff. the overall build quality feels sturdy, and the cable is a decent length (around 5 feet), offering ample movement range without tangling.\n",
      "\n",
      "performance (5/5): this is where the mouse shines. the optical sensor is responsive, offering accurate tracking for everyday tasks. whether you’re working on documents, browsing the web, or playing a light game, the mouse performs smoothly on various surfaces. there's no noticeable lag or erratic movement, and the cursor moves precisely where you expect. the dpi (dots per inch) isn't adjustable, but for most users, the default setting provides a good balance between speed and accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "installation (5/5): setup is straightforward. simply plug the usb cable into your computer, and the mouse is ready to use in seconds—no drivers or software installation required. it's compatible with both windows and macos, which is a big plus for those using multiple devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "durability (4/5): while the mouse is well-built for its price point, the plastic shell may not hold up as well as higher-end mice, especially with heavy use over time. the cable is flexible and should stand up to typical wear, but it could fray with constant bending. however, for the average user, this should last quite a while with proper care.\n",
      "\n",
      "value for money (5/5): at such a low price, this mouse offers exceptional value for money. it does exactly what it’s supposed to do without any frills or unnecessary features. if you're looking for a reliable, no-nonsense mouse without spending a lot, this is an excellent option.\n",
      "\n",
      "final thoughts: the amazon basics 3-button wired mouse is an outstanding budget pick. it provides solid performance, comfortable ergonomics, and a simple, reliable design. while it’s not packed with advanced features like adjustable dpi or extra buttons for gaming, it’s an excellent choice for everyday computing. ideal for home offices, students, and casual users alike, this mouse represents great value for money.\n",

      "Text: i have purchased mouse often, changing model or style, cheapest to expensive. somehow no mouse could satisfy me and after years of intense computer work i reached a conclusion no mouse will work well for me. some models were big, heavy, difficult to click with little effort, required often cleaning, would not work well on certain mouse pads. no single model felt well in my hand. after years on different jobs i stopped paying attention. mouse become part of hardship at work, something i did not care anymore. after years a moment arrived i needed a quiet mouse, positively quiet. so clicking and moving mouse will not add to sound i apply for testing microphones. start testing, one click, a moment later stop testing, second click. i noticed some mouse clicks were too loud for my measurements, changed microphone plots. i had to work with louder test setup or obtain quieter mouse. changing mousepad did not make things better for each mouse model i investigated. so a few years ago in desperation i purchased some fancy, expensive models and very cheap, generic models. i put all mice to testing, without labeling them, to avoid any bias. i quickly rejected most fancy models, some elegant white finish mouse was just no good for me. two models performed best and one of them is my favorite now, amazon basics. after a few years i confirmed this model worked for me and all test benches at work liked it for being quiet. i purchased 5 more. this mouse here, amazon basics really works best for me. least effort needed to click, mouse felt perfect in my hand, ergonomic to my hand that is rather medium size toward small. clicks sound is acceptable to my measurements, performance is equally quiet on mouse pad, on plain table surface and on randomly picked surfaces near always overcrowded test benches. mouse moves steadily on each surface, it is always reliable. i use many computer models, usb port flavors, windows from 7 to 11. this mouse always works just when plugged, i never had compatibility issue. i used it also on dusty table surface, never a problem. most critical task for me is designing of layout for electronics components with size between 1mm and 0.1mm, where i need big zoom on the scree and mouse needs to use it's high end of resolution. no problem here, very smooth operation as always. mouse is lightweight, usually lightweight i associate with \"cheap plastics\" products. not such perception here, due to my comfort and proven performance.\n",
