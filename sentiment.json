It fit well, functions well, is responsive, and the design reminds me of when computer mouses were first introduced, so the familiarity is refreshing. It tracks well, without too fast or slow a speed and doesn't need batteries. I bought it because it is wired and helps reduce the EMF around the computer from 20 mG with a wireless mouse to 0 mG for this one.",

    "text": "Overview: The Amazon Basics Responsive and Precise 3-Button Wired USB Computer Mouse is a simple yet effective peripheral for everyday use. Whether you're browsing, working, or gaming casually, this mouse delivers reliability and comfort without breaking the bank. It\u2019s a no-frills, budget-friendly option for those who just need a solid, functional mouse.\n\nBuild & Design (4/5): The mouse has a minimalist design, featuring a matte black finish that\u2019s smooth to the touch and resistant to fingerprints. It fits comfortably in most hands, though those with larger hands may find it a bit snug. The three main buttons (left, right, and scroll) are responsive and have a satisfying click, and the scroll wheel is accurate and not too stiff. The overall build quality feels sturdy, and the cable is a decent length (around 5 feet), offering ample movement range without tangling.\n\nPerformance (5/5): This is where the mouse shines. The optical sensor is responsive, offering accurate tracking for everyday tasks. Whether you\u2019re working on documents, browsing the web, or playing a light game, the mouse performs smoothly on various surfaces. There's no noticeable lag or erratic movement, and the cursor moves precisely where you expect. The DPI (dots per inch) isn't adjustable, but for most users, the default setting provides a good balance between speed and accuracy.\n\nInstallation (5/5): Setup is straightforward. Simply plug the USB cable into your computer, and the mouse is ready to use in seconds\u2014no drivers or software installation required. It's compatible with both Windows and macOS, which is a big plus for those using multiple devices.\n\nDurability (4/5): While the mouse is well-built for its price point, the plastic shell may not hold up as well as higher-end mice, especially with heavy use over time. The cable is flexible and should stand up to typical wear, but it could fray with constant bending. However, for the average user, this should last quite a while with proper care.\n\nValue for Money (5/5): At such a low price, this mouse offers exceptional value for money. It does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do without any frills or unnecessary features. If you're looking for a reliable, no-nonsense mouse without spending a lot, this is an excellent option.\n\nFinal Thoughts: The Amazon Basics 3-Button Wired Mouse is an outstanding budget pick. It provides solid performance, comfortable ergonomics, and a simple, reliable design. While it\u2019s not packed with advanced features like adjustable DPI or extra buttons for gaming, it\u2019s an excellent choice for everyday computing. Ideal for home offices, students, and casual users alike, this mouse represents great value for money.",

While I wasn't expecting any bells and whistles with this budget-friendly option, I've been pleasantly surprised by its functionality and performance. I use it for my lap top computer because I like the ease of using a mouse compared to finger application.\n\nStraightforward Setup and Use\n\nThis mouse is as advertised: a basic, 3-button wired mouse. It features the standard left and right clicks, a scroll wheel, and a wired USB connection. Setting it up is a breeze - simply plug it into your USB port, and you're ready to go. No drivers or software installation required.\n\nPerfect for Everyday Tasks and Budget-Conscious Gamers\n\nThe 1000 DPI optical tracking provides smooth cursor control, making it sufficient for everyday computer tasks like browsing, emailing, and navigating documents. It's a great option for someone who needs a simple, reliable mouse for basic use.\n\nOne surprising perk? My grandson, a passionate but budget-conscious gamer, has actually been using one of these mice for his gaming sessions. While it obviously lacks the fancy features of a high-end gaming mouse, he reports that it performs surprisingly well for casual gaming, especially considering the price point.\n\nSolid Value for Everyday Use\n\nOverall, the AmazonBasics 3-Button Wired USB Mouse is a solid value for everyday computer use. It's particularly attractive for those looking for a simple, affordable option or even a backup mouse. Gamers on a tight budget might also find it surprisingly functional for casual gaming.\n\nJust keep in mind that this is a basic mouse with a wired connection. If you're looking for a wireless mouse with extra buttons and programmable features, this might not be the best choice for you. But if you need a simple, reliable mouse at a great price, the Amazon Basics 3-Button Wired USB Mouse definitely fits the bill.",

Somehow no mouse could satisfy me and after years of intense computer work I reached a conclusion no mouse will work well for me. Some models were big, heavy, difficult to click with little effort, required often cleaning, would not work well on certain mouse pads. No single model felt well in my hand. After years on different jobs I stopped paying attention. Mouse become part of hardship at work, something I did not care anymore. After years a moment arrived I needed a quiet mouse, positively quiet. So clicking and moving mouse will not add to sound I apply for testing microphones. Start testing, one click, a moment later Stop testing, second click. I noticed some mouse clicks were too loud for my measurements, changed microphone plots. I had to work with louder test setup or obtain quieter mouse. Changing mousepad did not make things better for each mouse model I investigated. So a few years ago in desperation I purchased some fancy, expensive models and very cheap, generic models. I put all mice to testing, without labeling them, to avoid any bias. I quickly rejected most fancy models, some elegant white finish mouse was just no good for me. Two models performed best and one of them is my favorite now, Amazon Basics. After a few years I confirmed this model worked for me and all test benches at work liked it for being quiet. I purchased 5 more. This mouse here, Amazon Basics really works best for me. Least effort needed to click, mouse felt perfect in my hand, ergonomic to my hand that is rather medium size toward small. Clicks sound is acceptable to my measurements, performance is equally quiet on mouse pad, on plain table surface and on randomly picked surfaces near always overcrowded test benches. Mouse moves steadily on each surface, it is always reliable. I use many computer models, USB port flavors, Windows from 7 to 11. This mouse always works just when plugged, I never had compatibility issue. I used it also on dusty table surface, never a problem. Most critical task for me is designing of layout for electronics components with size between 1mm and 0.1mm, where I need big zoom on the scree and mouse needs to use it's high end of resolution. No problem here, very smooth operation as always. Mouse is lightweight, usually lightweight I associate with \"cheap plastics\" products. Not such perception here, due to my comfort and proven performance.",

This isn't just a mouse; it's a testament to the \"get-er-done\" ethos that powers through spreadsheets, homework, and those endless email threads with the finesse of a well-oiled machine.\n\nLet's cut to the chase: it's ultralight, making you wonder if Amazon discovered anti-gravity tech. Yet, it feels as reliable as that old family wagon, boasting a solid one-piece construction that resonates with a reassuring solidity at every tap. The clicks? They're the muted thuds of determination, ensuring you can work through nap times without waking the baby. And the scroll wheel, with its gentle rumbles, feels like cruising down the information highway with the top down.\n\nI've plugged this trooper into every computer in the house, tested it on desks, different pads, and even the kitchen counter \u2013 it just works. The cable's as steadfast as your commitment to Sunday family brunch, and the glide pads beneath? They ensure smooth sailing across many different landscapes, minimal yet mighty.\n\n\"Made in China,\" this mouse doesn't shy away from its roots, delivering an affordable, no-compromise tool that checks every box. Medium-sized for universal fit, it's the Goldilocks of mice - not too big, not too small, just right for the bulk of the population.\n\nWhy did I buy a case of 30? Because when you find something that works this well at keeping the daily grind moving, and need an affordable mouse this is it! It's the workhorse mouse that metaphorically \"brings home the bacon,\" fueling your day without draining the wallet.\n\nInitial look: for the huge selection of mouse out there this does not fall short for what you pay and what you get with the soft touch paint solid construction, high-quality wiring, good plug pads, decent laser, tracking, muted, click buttons muted, scroll wheel, and good size makes it a good purchase.

Not sure what went wrong, but my Macbook says that the voltage is not regulated correctly. Nothing visibly damaged, but it no longer works on any computer. Most of my other mice have lasted closer to 5-10 years, but at this price, hard to complain.",

It\u2019s straightforward, plug-and-play, and works perfectly on both my laptop and desktop without needing any software installation. The tracking is surprisingly responsive, and I find the scroll wheel smooth and easy to control, which is great for browsing and document work.\n\nThe size and shape of the mouse fit comfortably in my hand, even during extended use, and I appreciate the simple, no-frills design. The USB connection is reliable, so I never experience delays or dropped connections, which can be an issue with wireless mice. For a basic mouse, this Amazon Basics option really exceeded my expectations and is unbeatable for the price. If you\u2019re looking for a solid, no-nonsense wired mouse, I\u2019d definitely recommend this one!",
